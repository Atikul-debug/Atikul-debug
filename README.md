## 🧑‍💼 About Me

For me, coding is more than just typing on a keyboard; it’s about crafting architecture on a digital canvas. 
Over the past 2 years, I have been blending Flutter, Dart, Java, and JavaScript to build applications that simplify and enhance people's daily lives.


I believe a great app is more than just a collection of features—it’s an experience. 
Since I wrote my first 'Hello World' two years ago, my goal has been to solve real-world problems through code. 
Driven by that passion, I now craft high-performance solutions for Android, iOS, and Web platforms.


Technology is constantly evolving, and I thrive on adapting to those changes.
Embracing new challenges and engaging in collaborative growth—whether through learning or mentoring in coding workshops—is not just my work, 
but my passion.
